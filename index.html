  <h1>Hi! I'm Patrik and this is my personal website. </h1>
  <p>
  Currently I am in my final year of studying for a master's in Mathematics & Statistics at the University of Oxford. I am passionate about mathematics and I enjoy dabbling in technology. Have a look around this site to find out more about me. When I'm not next to a computer you'll usually find me by the nearest piano. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GerberPatrik">Here</a> are some old videos of me playing.
