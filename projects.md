1. Over the summer of 2018 I was fortunate enough to participate in [RIPS][RIPS_link]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient}. I worked in the team sponsored by AMD with [JJ][JJ_link]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient}, [Elvis][Elvis_link]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient} and [Kaman][Kaman_link]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient} mentored by [Tonmoy][Tonmoy_link]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient} and [Nick][Nick_link]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient}. You can take a look at what we did at our [repository][RIPS_repo]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient}

2. I interned in the Statistics department in Oxford where I was supervised by [Professor Paul Chleboun][Paul]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient}. The project was in the field of [IPS][IPS_link]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient}  --- we reproved some results about the mixing time of the East model, filling a gap in the contact process literature. Here's the [writeup][East_writeup]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient} and the [presentation][East_pres]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient}. 

3. As part of my degree in Mathematics and Statistics I completed a [bachelor's thesis][thesis]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient} on branching random walks with selection, supervised by [Professor Julien Berestycki][Julien]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient}. It is a largely self-contained glimpse into this recent field, and it can hopefully serve as a readable introduction to an advanced undergraduate studying mathematics.
