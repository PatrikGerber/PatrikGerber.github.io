1. Over the summer of 2018 I was fortunate enough to participate in [RIPS](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2018/). I worked in the team sponsored by AMD with [JJ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiajing-guan-a5606379/), [Elvis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elvis-nunez-ba7666102/) and [Kaman](http://kaman.phamdo.com/) mentored by [Tonmoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonmoy-monsoor-5730a82b/) and [Nick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasmalaya/). You can take a look at what we did at our [repository](https://github.com/AMD-RIPS/RL-2018)

2. I interned in the Statistics department in Oxford where I was supervised by [Professor Paul Chleboun](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/chleboun/). The project was in the field of [IPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interacting_particle_system)  --- we reproved some results about the mixing time of the East model, filling a gap in the contact process literature. Here's the [writeup](https://github.com/PatrikGerber/East-process/blob/master/East_process.pdf) and the [presentation](https://github.com/PatrikGerber/East-process/blob/master/East_process_presentation.pdf). 

3. As part of my degree in Mathematics and Statistics I completed a [bachelor's thesis](https://github.com/PatrikGerber/BRWs/blob/master/FINAL/final_version.pdf) on branching random walks with selection, supervised by [Professor Julien Berestycki](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/all-people/julien-berestycki/). It is a largely self-contained glimpse into this recent field, and it can hopefully serve as a readable introduction to an advanced undergraduate studying mathematics.
