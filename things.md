#### 1. Over the summer of 2018 I was fortunate enough to participate in [RIPS](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2018/). I worked in the team sponsored by AMD with [JJ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiajing-guan-a5606379/), [Elvis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elvis-nunez-ba7666102/) and [Kaman](http://kaman.phamdo.com/) mentored by [Tonmoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonmoy-monsoor-5730a82b/) and [Nick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasmalaya/). You can take a look at what we did at our [repository](https://github.com/AMD-RIPS/RL-2018)

#### 2. I was a summer research intern at the Department of Statistics in Oxford. I was supervised by Professor Paul Chleboun and I worked in the field of interacting particle systems. We reproved some interesting results about the East model, [here](https://github.com/PatrikGerber/East-process) is a writeup.
