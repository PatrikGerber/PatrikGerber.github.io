<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>
This is my personal website that I made for fun. In the future I hope to turn this into my academic webpage maybe with some blog posts, until then it will just function as a resume/creative side-project. 
</p>
I recently completed a degree in Mathematics and Statistics at the Univeristy of Oxford, and I will be joining the Mathematics department at MIT to start my PhD in Applied Mathematics this fall. Here is a link to my [resume][resume_link]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient} and my [Linkedin profile][Linkedin_link]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient}. In my free time I enjoy playing the piano, you can find some old videos of me on [youtube][youtube_link]{:.highlight.transparent.gradient}.
