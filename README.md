This is my small personal website, a work in progress. It is built on the default [brutalist](https://github.com/kwhaler/brutalist-jekyll) theme. 

### How to use
1. To set up follow [this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) guide. 
2. In the root directory of your Jekyll site, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
