This is my personal website, a work in progress. It is built on the default [brutalist](https://github.com/kwhaler/brutalist-jekyll) theme. 

### How to run
1. To set up Jekyll follow [this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) guide. 
2. To host locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the root directory of your Jekyll site. 
3. To update the live gh-pages site just push changes to master branch. 

### Reminders to myself
1. If the live website won't update then your browser might have the old page [cached](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47443046). In Chrome go to `Menu > More Tools > Clear Browsing Data`. 
2. Latex is supported via [Mathjax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html).
